``` Autonomous-Vehicle-Simulation ```

+ Involves working with the chosen simulation platform
+ Defining algorithms for path planning
+ Object detection and decision making

### I will implement high level Python based code 
+ Used: Carla and Basic Algorithms

Based on the specific requirements and the capabilities of the chosen simulator, the tasks have been divided.
1. Path Planning
2. Object Detection
3. Decision Making
4. Simulation Control and Evaluation
